Fastar Game Score Repository

Proving your tabletop dominance empirically.

Project description:

We'll go into business as a data storage and display company, making money via ads on the page, as well as selling aggregate data to interested parties. Users will be able to visit our home page, select a game, and submit their score and game parameters, adding them to our database, and we will tell them how their score compares to other players.
Paid users will experience the site without ads.

Team:

I'm looking to form a team of 4, including myself, should this idea be sufficiently popular.

Implementation:

We plan to implement the MVP with a SQL back-end, web front-end, migrating to a No-SQL back-end once the need arises.

SQL

Looking to use Access or similar for the SQL database, but am open to suggestions.

No-SQL

Looking to use a key-value database, specifically DynamoDB or similar, again open to suggestions.

BOLTS

Business

Our monetization will be primarily through ad revenue until we've collected enough data to be able to sell to interested parties in aggregate.
Game publishers will be able to purchase a premium spot on our home page, such that their game is featured more prominently.
Users will be able to pay for an ad-free experience.

Operation

The founders will operate the website until it becomes successful enough to sell to a larger company, at which point the founders will go their separate ways.

Legal

The business will be a Utah LLC.

Technical

Priorities include:
Acquiring a memorable, relevant, domain name.
Prototyping the database in SQL
Prototyping the front-end
Implementing the MVP

Social

We aim to gain traffic through word of mouth, encouraging local game groups and businesses to recommend us to their members and customers, offering a local group ranking in exchange.
